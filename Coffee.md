## Instant Coffee isn't great

> Coffee is great. You must try some.

Regular instant coffee (normal supermarket variety: nestle, bru, folgers) is really bad. If you enjoy it then there's nothing wrong but it leaves a lot of things to be desired. Consider trying out good coffee(beans & brew technique).

The problem is that corporations buy cheap commodity grade coffee to reduce the price. Their business model requires that
i. Coffee be cheap. Hence the farmer has little incentive to grow good produce because the produce will fetch the same rate in the market.
ii. But even if the produce were good then the point of a corporate brand is to ensure consistency. All coffee of a brand must taste the same. A sizeable chunk of the market demands the ol reliable.
iii. To make instant coffee you take coffee beans, roast em, brew coffee and freeze-dry it removing all the water. Hence, the thing in the instant coffee bottle is not coffee beans but rather actual coffee that's extremely concentrated.

Overall, the cup of coffee taste a little wattery, not rich & too bitter. Which is why lots of people use milk and sugar to make it more pallatable. I do consume this coffee with milk and sugar ocassionally and enjoy it. It is however lacking for the daily morning cup. I would rather do some green tea or kashmiri kahwa rather than coffee as my daily if this was my only option. Which I did do a for a few years before.

## What's out there

Just like anything in life there exist a number of people who are extremely passinate about coffee. The beans, the technique, the recipe. Everthing is explored with excruciating detail. I won't be able to do justice to the passion out there so here's a rundown of the basics. Do note that going for fresh coffee will increase the cost considerably. I will share some rough numbers below.

- Get freshly roasted beans.
- Grind those beans.
- Brew coffee.
- ???
- Profit.

1. Most coffee sellers will grind your beans to a size depending on your brew method. Prefer this until you can buy a good coffee grinder. Grinders can go from USD20-40 to 100's.
2. Three Basic brewing methods. There are many more methods and some methods fall into multiple categories.
	- Immersion
		i. Throw coffee grounds into hot water, wait. Filter out grounds and enjoy your brew.
		ii. French press are cheap and beginner friendly. Also, maybe clever dripper.
	- Percolation
		i. Coffee grounds will be places on top of a filter and water will be poured on top, come out as brewed coffee from the bottom.
		ii. V60 (looks like a funnel) is beginner friendly. Helpful to have a goose-neck kettle along.
	- Pressurised
		i. Pass hot pressurised water through coffee beans. E.g Espresso family
		ii. Moka Pot is the low cost option.

## My Current Setup(V60)

- Drip brew using a Hario plastic V60. [link](https://global.hario.com/sp_v60series.html)
- Grinder: Timemore C2
- Hario filter papers. White.
- Coffee: Generally light roasts. I have enjoyed a lot of coffee from [Grey Soul Coffee](https://greysoul.coffee), especially their Biccode Estate.
- Cost
	1. Hario V60 Plastic Size 2: ₹468 ~ 6-7 USD
	2. Timemore C2: ₹4300 ~ 63 USD
	3. Hario Filter papers: ₹421 for 100. ~ 5-6 USD
	4. Coffee Beans: ₹600 for 250 gms, roughly 18 gms per mug of coffee. ~ ₹50 a mug. About 0.7 USD.
	5. I've been using this for over two years so the dripper & grinder costs have definitely amortised.
