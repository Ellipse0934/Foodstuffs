Thoughts and recipes related to food & drink. I'm no chef. No guarantees about how this food will turn out. Probably edible and won't kill ye, use your judgement.

Too many websites & videos on the internet which are not succinct and take 10-12 minutes of your time because they want to artificially increase engagement and make ad revenue. I'm not opposed to the idea and certain content does take a lot of time and it must be fiscally justified with sponsorship & ads. However it's getting ridiculous these days where they want to tell you a 7 minute story in a 12 minute video. Content is often disorganised and the ingredients, technique and quirks is not described well. Hopefully I avoid that.

Oh and also this is primarily for myself because I don't want to have a physical cookbook for reference.

Bon App√©tit!
